In addition to my studies I use my free time to learn new technology independently. Thanks to this autonomy I was able to get a job as a working student during my first semester at university and to gain knowledge in data science.  However my love is not in data science but in web and mobile development.",

During my stay at ISEA I mainly worked as a working student.During my work at ISEA I was mainly in charge of extracting the data from the measurements on the batteries and then representing these data in order to facilitate their exploitation. I really enjoyed my work at ISEA because of its diversity. For example, one of the last tasks I had to do was to build a neural network, an LSTM to be more precise, in order to discover the physical factors that most impact the aging of Lithium-ion Batteries. And so I was able to acquire basic knowledge in Data science and artificial intelligence.During my work there I used Matlab and Python for all my tasks."
